# Toy models for Cauchy-Characteristic Extraction (CCE) and Matching (CCM)
 
This repository contains the code used in the paper [arxiv XXX.XXXXX](...).
The goal of this work is to analyze the numerical convergence of CCE and CCM
for toy models that mimic the hyperbolic structure of the general relativistic PDE systems
used in CCE and CCM.

The code is written in the [Julia programming languange](https://julialang.org/) as a module,
and tested in Julia version 1.8.5.

## Installation

Change to your local directory where the repository "model_CCE_CCM_public" is
saved. The module can be installed using Julia's REPL mode:
```
julia> ]
pkg> add .
```
